# Laravel SOAP Gateway

Laravel SOA Gateway is a work in progress project for creating a basic API Gateway using SOAP protocol. 
It will cover basic functionalities Forum Sentry's API Gateway does for the SOAP invocations.

## Features

The core feature will be:
- routing of SOAP calls
- client authentication via X509 certificates
- allowing only a certain quantity of incoming calls for second
- check for some internal XML values based on certificate used during authentication

This project is in its early stages (as on February 20, 2022). Please let me know if you're interested in it.
